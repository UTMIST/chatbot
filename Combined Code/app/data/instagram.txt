🤖Project Keynote: How UTMIST Accidentally Changed My Life - An Unconventional Path Into Startups
💻Project: Omni - Retrieval Augmented Generation
✅Keywords: Retrieval Augmented Generation | NLP | Large Language Models

🔥Matthew Ao is a part-time student and full-time startup builder. He recently co-founded a software startup with Dan Koe (@thedankoe), a 7-figure entrepreneur and content creator. Previously, Matthew was a software engineer at Aviato.co and a Founding Engineer at Omnilabs.ai (@omniscience.ai). He is a Computer Engineering 2T5 student at the University of Toronto, and has started two UTMIST projects in the past: Humerus Bot, an AI that wins at Cards Against Humanity, and Omni, a neural information retrieval system that writes using knowledge from users’ uploaded documents. 

“Joining UTMIST dramatically changed my life. It accidentally pushed me into the startup world, which led me to eventually co-found a startup with @thedankoe. I share the lessons I’ve learned along the way, including what wealth actually means—family, fitness, freedom—and how to get there. The conventional 'consumer' path trades time for money—get a degree, get a job, and slave away at a 9 to 5 for 40 years. While it is secure, an ordinary path does not yield extraordinary results. The unconventional ‘producer’ path trades curiosity & value creation for lasting wealth and freedom in 10 years or less. I share the key lessons that I learned through my unconventional path into the startup world, and how starting a UTMIST project sparked it all. If just one audience member decides to start their own UTMIST project as a result of my talk, the keynote will have been a success.”

Keynote Title: Learning for Logical Reasoning and Low-level Motion Planning in Robotics

Task and motion planning (TAMP) problems in robotics are an instance of methods that combine logical reasoning and low-level motion planning, to enable complex, multi-step tasks. TAMP solvers typically combine symbolic planning over discrete task variables and abstractions of the state with motion optimization over continuous state and action variables, resulting in trajectories that satisfy the logical constraints imposed on the task variables. Despite significant progress in TAMP solvers over the last decade, several core problems remain open, one of them being that it is not clear what the role of learning should be to improve them. In this talk, we will show how to design TAMP solvers that learn to plan better and faster from past experience of solving similar problems in similar environments. We will show how a learning-based TAMP system can plan long-horizon manipulation tasks in various environments, including in chemistry labs, where robot arms can execute a diverse range of multi-step liquid handling experiments. #robotics #machinelearning #keynote #conference #computerscience #logicalreasoningOne of the most successful UTMIST projects -🔥WallStreetBots: Crypto Price Prediction🔥- will deliver a keynote at EigenAI Conference by Project Director Lisa Yu, Final Year Computer Science Specialist student with Focus in AI and a Math Major at University of Toronto.

Keynote Title:
Neural rendering at one trillion frames per second
 
Keynote Abstract:
The world looks different at one trillion frames per second: light slows to a crawl, and we can observe “transients”—ultrafast light transport phenomena that are completely invisible to the naked eye. These transients provide valuable cues for recovering 3D appearance and geometry and can be a powerful signal for scene reconstruction when combined with neural representations. While neural representations have led to profound improvements in 3D reconstruction using conventional RGB images, application to transients has been largely unexplored despite the widespread deployment of ultrafast imagers (e.g., the lidar array on the iPhone). In this talk, I overview applications of ultrafast imaging and describe recent work on transient neural rendering for 3D reconstruction and synthesis of transients from novel views. I also discuss challenges and opportunities for neural rendering at one trillion frames per second, including free viewpoint rendering of transient phenomena, handling of relativistic effects, and applications to imaging with individual photons.

See you there on Sunday!🚨Themes Highlights Of Hack The MIST🚨
🌇Art:
1️⃣Art and Machine learning intersects in a variety of ways. With ML, we can generate and analyze artwork, develop new artistic styles, help us understand paintings, photographs, or music by identifying patterns and creating new compositions. While one is creative and the other computational, don’t underestimate the power of the two together! 

🤖Natural Language Processing:
2️⃣Machine learning has made significant advancements in NLP over the past decade, allowing for the development of sophisticated applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and machine translation systems in a variety of industries including healthcare, finance, and customer service. These applications can help break down language barriers, improve communication, and make information more accessible to people who speak different languages. The motive behind this theme is to tackle the challenging problem of enabling computers to understand and communicate with humans in a more natural and intuitive way.

💥Climate Change:
3️⃣Climate change is one of the most pressing global issues of our time. Machine learning comes in handy to mitigate the impact of climate change. It can be used to analyze large datasets of weather patterns, satellite imagery, and carbon emissions to make more accurate climate predictions. It can also be used to develop models for more efficient energy use and to optimize renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. This information can be used to develop more effective strategies for disaster response and preparedness.🔥Technical Writer Dev Shah🔥, a first-year Computer Science student at UofT, is publishing a medium article on deMISTify discussing Federated Learning and how it solves major issues and limitations in AI and Medical Imaging🩻; starting from basics, Dev also discusses the future direction and applications of Federated Learning.

🏨"Many medical images are not properly labeled and radiologists need to spend time and resources in labeling the data to train the model. [... To address this issue], a new machine learning framework has been proposed, Federated Learning. This framework allows for local sites to train a universal model and iterate on the model to increase efficiency and accuracy."

#hackathon #machinelearning🔥UTMIST Technical Writer Shirley Wang, a Computer Science MSc student at UofT, is publishing a medium article on deMISTify discussing Diffusion Models and its applications: DALL-E 2. 

📌The full article can be found at our bio (A Brief Overview of Diffusion Models and DALL-E 2) or subscribe our newsletter.

To help you better understand this advanced ML topic, we've summarized three key terms for you:

✅Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs for short, are an approach to generative modelling using deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks.

✅Markov Chain: A Markov chain is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. Informally, this may be understood as, "What happens next depends only on the state of affairs now."

✅Noise Reduction: A process to reduce or remove visibility of noise by smoothing an entire image leaving areas near contrast boundaries.
