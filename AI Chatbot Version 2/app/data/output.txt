RL Program FAQs for Marketing Purpose

Can graduate students participate? Is it only for U of T students? 
Yes, definitely! We welcome undergraduate and graduate students! Also, it’s for everyone, including students outside of U of T. However, currently, we plan to offer this program in-person only at Bahen Center, UTSG. It may change based on student feedback and preference after the first session.

I only did one course in introductory computer programming and some first-year math courses. Will I be ready to participate in the RL program?
RL is math heavy more than programming heavy. We encourage you to still attend, but it would be optimal if you have learned convergent series, probability distributions, and sampling in your previous coursework or project work. 

If you’re prepared with higher level programming and math knowledge such as linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and PyTorch, and you would like to dive deep into ML, our Paper Reading Group starting Feb 29, 2024 may be a great fit for you. You can attend both! 

Why does UTMIST offer this program? Does U of T teach it? What specific topics will be covered in this month-long program?
U of T does not offer a course which focuses primarily in Reinforcement Learning at St. George campus for undergraduate students. 

We will cover topics from learning with dynamic programming and tabular-based methods to value function approximation and policy gradient methods. We wish to give a rundown of all the popular and leading-edge topics in the field of RL.

Will the sessions be recorded? What if I miss a session? 
We will do our best to do recordings, which depends on the room AV system at Bahen. 

Our Academic Director works very hard to prepare slides and content for this program. Therefore, if you decide to participate in this program and aim to maximize your learning, we highly recommend you to attend all sessions on-site and ask your questions to our Academic Director during or after each session. 

Will there be office hours or tutorial sessions? What if I have questions during the study of this program? 
Our Academic Director currently doesn’t plan to hold office hours, but it may change depending on student feedback and questions after the first session. 

We'll also be available during the session each week to answer any questions you may have. Of course, you can always message us or start a discussion on Discord. 

Join UTMIST discord: https://discord.com/invite/88mSPw8 

What can I do next after completion of the RL program? What should I take away? 
Sessions will be lecture-style and knowledge-focused. You’ll be empowered with knowledge! If you enjoy RL, then you can explore research in the area as it's quite popular now. After the program, you’ll be ready to discuss it with a potential faculty supervisor during your application to a research program or supervised study course, read seminal papers in this field, and explore your own research topics, ultimately conducting advanced research in RL.

Why is it important to learn paper reading?
Because ML is such a fast evolving field and a lot of knowledge is not in textbooks or courses but fresh in newly published papers! Reading papers is the best way to keep up with the progress in this field!

What are some benefits of learning it? 
Our sessions will help you succeed in your school courses by supplementing them with hands-on experience! You will gain a deeper understanding of the architectures, experience using the PyTorch library. 

What topics will be covered in this series of sessions?
There will be four sessions with different focuses! First session focuses on vision, the second session on GAN, and the last two on NLP. 

What types of papers are we reading?
We are covering some of the most influential ML papers in the past decade! For example, during the first session, we will explore the ResNet and MobileNet paper. 

What does the session look like?
Each session will contain: a brief survey of the related field and background, a deep dive into the selected papers, live coding demonstration that implements part of the key architecture or technique. 

Who is teaching us?
Our UTMIST’s academics team! 

Does UofT offer similar courses related to paper reading?
Yes! APS360, ECE324, and CSC413 cover very similar topics! Our session complements the course curriculum!

What prerequisite knowledge do I need to have?
Basic knowledge of deep learning (everything related to a vanilla neural net). It's great if you also know the CNN architecture, but that's not required. 

Will it be recorded? What if I miss a session?
Unfortunately there are no recordings. However, the sessions have separate topics so even if you miss one you can still go to the next one!

Title: 
Text-to-4D Generation Using Hybrid Score Distillation Sampling

Abstract:
Recent breakthroughs in text-to-4D generation rely on pre-trained text-to-image and text-to-video models to generate dynamic 3D scenes. However, current text-to-4D methods face a three-way tradeoff between the quality of scene appearance, 3D structure, and motion. For example, text-to-image models and their 3D-aware variants are trained on internet-scale image datasets and can be used to produce scenes with realistic appearance and 3D structure-but no motion. Text-to-video models are trained on relatively smaller video datasets and can produce scenes with motion, but poorer appearance and 3D structure. While these models have complementary strengths, they also have opposing weaknesses, making it difficult to combine them in a way that alleviates this three-way tradeoff. Here, we introduce hybrid score distillation sampling, an alternating optimization procedure that blends supervision signals from multiple pre-trained diffusion models and incorporates benefits of each for high-fidelity text-to-4D generation. Using hybrid SDS, we demonstrate synthesis of 4D scenes with compelling appearance, 3D structure, and motion.

Keynote Speaker #2 - Jonas Guan
Title:
Introduction to Hebbian Learning

Abstract:
Backpropagation is the cornerstone of deep learning, yet it’s not biologically plausible, and falls far short of the brain’s efficiency and robustness. Unlike backprop, which is purely error-driven, the brain’s learning process integrates the associative, unsupervised Hebbian learning with error-driven learning, to spectacular results. Hebbian-based learning promises increased parallelization, sparsity, data reuse across tasks, and robustness against adversarial examples. This talk explores how to design Hebbian deep learning algorithms for artificial neural networks. Drawing upon recent advancements in neuroscience on biological learning, we embark on an adventure to develop biologically-inspired learning algorithms that could redefine our approach to AI.

Speaker Bio

Abstract 
https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02850  
In this paper reading/ paper breakdown, we break down the paper explaining the interesting field of 5D vision. We will first start by providing an overview of how the problem can be built and what exactly the problem statement with this area of works usually is and then we explore intuitively how the models in "TRACE: 5D Temporal Regression of Avatars with Dynamic Cameras in 3D Environments" paper work towards solving this problem. We mainly target undergraduate students who are interested in learning about the field of vision! We expect high-school math to best understand the content we present.

U of T MIST and U of T AI are both prominent machine intelligence clubs at the University of Toronto. While U of T AI focuses on the Department of Computer Science, UTMIST, established in 2017 under the Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering, operates cross-faculty.
One key distinction is that UTMIST has dedicated design teams within the Engineering Department, leading research and development initiatives. We produce our academic content independently, fostering a unique learning environment. Unlike general memberships, we emphasize internal involvement. You can also check out our LinkedIn profiles of our members’ showcase of their achievements and contributions within UTMIST.
