We apply and invent Bayesian multi-armed bandit algorithms to automatically conduct and improve A/B testing, along with novel statistical techniques to avoid erroneous inferences. We illustrate using AI for social good by incorporating cognitive, social, and clinical psychology, from education to mental and physical health. We discuss the application of these techniques to solving business problems, such as improving websites, emails, recommender systems, and any user interfaces and products.\n#abtesting #machinelearning #interface #keynote #conference #aiforsocialgood #ai #ml #psychology #algorithms\ud83d\udd25\u2764\ufe0fEigenAI Networking Booth: Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence!

He recently co-founded a software startup with Dan Koe (@thedankoe), a 7-figure entrepreneur and content creator. Previously, Matthew was a software engineer at Aviato.co and a Founding Engineer at Omnilabs.ai (@omniscience.ai). He is a Computer Engineering 2T5 student at the University of Toronto, and has started two UTMIST projects in the past: Humerus Bot, an AI that wins at Cards Against Humanity, and Omni, a neural information retrieval system that writes using knowledge from users\u2019 uploaded documents. \n\n\u201cJoining UTMIST dramatically changed my life. It accidentally pushed me into the startup world, which led me to eventually co-found a startup with @thedankoe. I share the lessons I\u2019ve learned along the way, including what wealth actually means\u2014family, fitness, freedom\u2014and how to get there. The conventional 'consumer' path trades time for money\u2014get a degree, get a job, and slave away at a 9 to 5 for 40 years. While it is secure, an ordinary path does not yield extraordinary results. The unconventional \u2018producer\u2019 path trades curiosity & value creation for lasting wealth and freedom in 10 years or less. I share the key lessons that I learned through my unconventional path into the startup world, and how starting a UTMIST project sparked it all. If just one audience member decides to start their own UTMIST project as a result of my talk, the keynote will have been a success.\u201d\n\n\ud83c\udf7eCollaborating with @uoftcssu UTMIST will be hosting EigenAI Conference on September 16, 2023, from 9 AM - 5 PM at BA1160 & BA1130.\n\n\u203c\ufe0fFewer than 100 general admission tickets left! \nLINK IN OUR BIO\n#nlp #naturallanguageprocessing \n#machinelearning #chatgpt #largelanguagemodels #ai \n#keynote #conference #event \n#product #startup #entrepreneur\ud83d\udd25EigenAI Conference Keynote Speaker: Prof. Florian Shkurti.

TAMP solvers typically combine symbolic planning over discrete task variables and abstractions of the state with motion optimization over continuous state and action variables, resulting in trajectories that satisfy the logical constraints imposed on the task variables. Despite significant progress in TAMP solvers over the last decade, several core problems remain open, one of them being that it is not clear what the role of learning should be to improve them. In this talk, we will show how to design TAMP solvers that learn to plan better and faster from past experience of solving similar problems in similar environments. We will show how a learning-based TAMP system can plan long-horizon manipulation tasks in various environments, including in chemistry labs, where robot arms can execute a diverse range of multi-step liquid handling experiments. #robotics #machinelearning #keynote #conference #computerscience #logicalreasoningOne of the most successful UTMIST projects -\ud83d\udd25WallStreetBots: Crypto Price Prediction\ud83d\udd25- will deliver a keynote at EigenAI Conference by Project Director Lisa Yu, Final Year Computer Science Specialist student with Focus in AI and a Math Major at University of Toronto.

Collaborating with @uoftcssu UTMIST will be hosting EigenAI Conference on September 16, 2023, from 9 AM - 5 PM at BA1160 & BA1130.\n\nDavid Lindell is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto. His research combines optics, emerging sensor platforms, neural representations, and physics-based algorithms to enable new capabilities in visual computing. Prof. Lindell\u2019s research has a wide array of applications including autonomous navigation, virtual and augmented reality, and remote sensing. Prior to joining the University of Toronto, he received his Ph.D. from Stanford University. He is the recipient of the 2021 ACM SIGGRAPH Outstanding Dissertation Honorable Mention Award.\n\nKeynote Title:\nNeural rendering at one trillion frames per second\n \nKeynote Abstract:\nThe world looks different at one trillion frames per second: light slows to a crawl, and we can observe \u201ctransients\u201d\u2014ultrafast light transport phenomena that are completely invisible to the naked eye. These transients provide valuable cues for recovering 3D appearance and geometry and can be a powerful signal for scene reconstruction when combined with neural representations. While neural representations have led to profound improvements in 3D reconstruction using conventional RGB images, application to transients has been largely unexplored despite the widespread deployment of ultrafast imagers (e.g., the lidar array on the iPhone). In this talk, I overview applications of ultrafast imaging and describe recent work on transient neural rendering for 3D reconstruction and synthesis of transients from novel views. I also discuss challenges and opportunities for neural rendering at one trillion frames per second, including free viewpoint rendering of transient phenomena, handling of relativistic effects, and applications to imaging with individual photons. \n \nTarget all segments of audiences: \n\ud83d\udcdaBeginners\n\ud83e\udd16Enthusiasts\n\ud83c\udfc6Researchers\n(Learn more & sign up from our bio!)\ud83d\udd25UTMIST IS NOW HIRING 2023-24 ASSOCIATES & DIRECTORS (New Positions Announced)\u203c\ufe0f\n\ud83d\udcc6Deadline: Aug 21st, 2023\n\ud83d\udcbbHow to apply?

With ML, we can generate and analyze artwork, develop new artistic styles, help us understand paintings, photographs, or music by identifying patterns and creating new compositions. While one is creative and the other computational, don\u2019t underestimate the power of the two together! \n\n\ud83e\udd16Natural Language Processing:\n2\ufe0f\u20e3Machine learning has made significant advancements in NLP over the past decade, allowing for the development of sophisticated applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and machine translation systems in a variety of industries including healthcare, finance, and customer service. These applications can help break down language barriers, improve communication, and make information more accessible to people who speak different languages. The motive behind this theme is to tackle the challenging problem of enabling computers to understand and communicate with humans in a more natural and intuitive way.\n\n\ud83d\udca5Climate Change:\n3\ufe0f\u20e3Climate change is one of the most pressing global issues of our time. Machine learning comes in handy to mitigate the impact of climate change. It can be used to analyze large datasets of weather patterns, satellite imagery, and carbon emissions to make more accurate climate predictions. It can also be used to develop models for more efficient energy use and to optimize renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. This information can be used to develop more effective strategies for disaster response and preparedness.\ud83d\udd25Technical Writer Dev Shah\ud83d\udd25, a first-year Computer Science student at UofT, is publishing a medium article on deMISTify discussing Federated Learning and how it solves major issues and limitations in AI and Medical Imaging\ud83e\ude7b; starting from basics, Dev also discusses the future direction and applications of Federated Learning.\n\n\ud83c\udfe8\"Many medical images are not properly labeled and radiologists need to spend time and resources in labeling the data to train the model.
